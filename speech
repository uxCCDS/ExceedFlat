Voice Application -> Change Voice (Properity) -> Decorate Voice -> Melody -> ultrasound! (Interesting)

Hello every one, good morning, My Name is Arhtus! Firstly, let's applaud for Fiona's Speech again. She did real good job.
Through her speech, I believe you have a general understanding on the research done by the prototype team.

/*
We get inspirations across fileds.
We blend the lastest technology into our designs.
We explore the new possibility.
*/

As we all know, the technology is complex. We make it easier for user , and I make you better understanding.

I prepared an interesting topic for you , this morning!

It's my first time to Oslo. When I searched this area in Google map, I found some club and music hall!!

HM! I think it's a right place for my topic!

Rock up! The Interaction of sound.


--------------------------- rockUp ---------------------------

==> Click subtitle. PLAY NOKIA 

Are you familiar with this ring?

Nokia is not yesterday's Nokia, but the good memory is still buried in our heart.

Now! What's the fisrt app come to your mind which is lated to sound?

Music App? Record App? Hey, it's a talk from prototype team. Let's think of something rated to the high technology?

--------------------------- speechRecognition ---------------------------

Yes! Siri! I heard it!

Steven Jobs brought it to the world in 2011 with IPhone 4S.

From them on, the world started to pay more attention to the speech recognition area. And, we!! has already tried to add this technology to our prototype some times.

I still remember that it's the first project in Cisco. It's a prototype for windows phone 8. Taya encouraged me to add something new outside the normal interaction.

Then I touched face decetion and wrote a javascript library for speech recognition. It's so lucky for me to work with the talent people here.

Here is a sample shows the how it works.

==> Click Icon to play

After I click this icon, it starts to listen to the users. This wave animation shows the voice's change. If the server gets my voice successfully, it will return a text.
I can bind the text to an command. Such as 'next' to the next page. 

If not success ? :P

--------------------------- speechRecognitionThinking ---------------------------

Here is a summary for speech recognition.

-Voice-Text-Action

At first, we start to listen to the environment and get sound data.
Then the cloud server will convert the sound to text. Thanks to big data, it's more accurate now!
Finally we can program with the text just like the normal input from keyboard.

Remember it! 

...

This is the speech recognition. Differnet actions create different apps. Reading voice mail, translate different languages and so on.

--------------------------- decorate Sound ---------------------------

Ofcourse, we can not only analysis sound, but also decorate sound!

We listen to the music! 

Everybody like beatuiful things. 

I know amap App even invite a super model in China to record the voice packets.

: Story

And we can PS sound just like you PS photo.


Before diving in this part, I'd like share my own experience.
It was happened that I bought an eletric guitar when I started to learn Web Audio API.  The board of the guitar speaker and the web audio api are amazing similar.
The knowledge accross field really helps engineering a lot!!!


--------------------------- guitarSpeakers ---------------------------

Here is an image of guitar speaker.

You can see some Knobs on this speakers. 

The GAIN Knob and the Volumes can adjust the volume.

The Delay node can make the music play few seconds later.

The reverb node is very popular! I think most of people like use reverb when they single karaoke.

The other nodes offers some speical effect for guitar. Like Riffer ,Metal...

I can also find some similar interface to code according to the web audio api.

Just like filter for photoshop!

--------------------------- soundInSpace ---------------------------

And you can even ask for more!

Because music exist in the time and space.

What do you see?  A man ? Yes

And now? Some people. This is like the current spark meeting. The active speaker is also in the center. All the people hear the same voice.

OK! Let's try to do some changes! Now it is more like a round table meeting. 

Do you remeber the 360 camera and VR ?  You will have a 360 view! And the most important thing here is that different people should here different sound in different position.

Try to enjoy the music!

I am going to change to position of the sound source.

Can you feel the sound come from right to left and front to back?!

! Sorry for disturbing you to enjoy music ! 

But, do you feel more curious about sound?

--------------------------- essence ---------------------------\

HM! Let me show you the essence of sound to you ?

Fisrt, I'd like to talk something about Music theory. I know people from design team never lack of sense of Art.

I believe you can recognize what I show you in the next page.


--------------------------- melody ---------------------------

So! What's this?!

musical alphabet

Software engineers are thinking with 1 and 0 to build their utopia while musicians play with music notes to construct their Garden of Eden.

The morden music is base on a famous temperament. 

twelve-tone equal temperament!!!

---> As we all know, sound wave is a kind of mechanical wave. Wave has its own frequency.

According to twelve-tone equal temperament, 440 hz is the frequency of 'LA'. So the A in the previous group is 220 hz.

In twelve-tone equal temperament, which divides the octave into 12 equal parts, the width of a semitone, i.e. the frequency ratio of the interval between two adjacent notes, is the twelfth root of two. So we can get the freqency of other notes refer to the following code.

Till now we can get the frequency of every note! Luckily, the browser enanbles us to create an Oscillator node to create a sound at any frequency the device can send.

Guess what we can do!

--------------------------- ultrasound ---------------------------

I've talked all! But that's not all. Geek not stop exploring the world. I tried to make more possibility  for our prototype.

Look this!

This line shows the frequency range of the sound that the computer can send. From 0 - 22050

Our 440hz 'LA' is at the very begining of the line. 

And you can see the frequency of guitar, piano and singer.


Let's listen to the environment here.

Watch the chart!

When you the frequency of sound is over 20000, it becomes ultrasound. People can not listen to it.

And we can use the ultrasound to transform data.

Have you ever tried proxmity?
