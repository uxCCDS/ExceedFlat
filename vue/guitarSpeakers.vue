            <p>Here is an image of guitar speaker.</p>
            <p>You can see some Knobs on this speakers. </p>
            <p>The GAIN Knob and the Volumes Knob can adjust the volume.</p>
            <p>The Delay Knob can make the music play few seconds later.</p>
            <p>Reverb is very popular! I think most of people like use reverb when they single karaoke.</p>
            <p>The other Knobs offers some speical effect for guitar. Like Riffer ,Metal...</p>
            <p>I can also find some similar interface to code according to the web audio api.</p>
            <p>Just like filter for photoshop! And you can even ask for more! Because music exist in the time and space.</p>
